## Hi there 👋  

I am a software developer with experience in building scalable applications using the Go language and various technologies such as Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Docker, GraphQL, gRPC, and RabbitMQ. I use the Testify framework to ensure applications are well-tested and maintainable.

Lately, I've been diving into the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, especially working with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like **OpenAI GPT** and **Anthropic Claude**. I enjoy exploring **prompt engineering**, and integrating LLMs into backend systems for tasks like intelligent automation.

- 🌱 **Learning:** Microservices, Kubernetes, and LLM integration  
- 🤖 **AI Interest:** Prompt engineering, document extraction, contract analysis using LLMs  
- 🔭 **Language:** Go, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- 💬 **Hobbies:** Basketball & coding  
- ⚡ **Fun Fact:** I’m a huge **One Piece** fan! :pirate_flag:  
- 📫 Reach me at **saufiroja08@gmail.com**
